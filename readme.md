# CRUD Web Application Demo for RBH

This is a demo project that demonstrates CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. The frontend of the application is built using React.js with Vite, while the backend is built using Nest.js. PostgreSQL is used as the database. You can use the provided `docker-compose.yml` file at the root of the project to initialize and run the project easily.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, make sure you have the following tools installed on your machine:

- Docker: [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- Docker Compose: [Install Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

## Getting Started

To set up and run the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the Git repository:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/prin3x/rbh_assignment
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```shell
   cd rbh_assignment
    ```

3. Build and run the project using Docker Compose:
    ```shell
    docker-compose up --build
    ```
4. Once the containers are up and running, you can access the application in your browser at http://localhost:5173/


## Usage
The application provides a user interface to perform CRUD operations on the data stored in the PostgreSQL database. Use the UI to create, read, update, and delete data entries.
